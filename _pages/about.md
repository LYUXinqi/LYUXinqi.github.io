I'm a second-year doctoral student from [School of PI](https://pi.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests include neural networks, machine learning, flow networks, thermal management, and flow control.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chen Weifang of [the Near-Space Vehicle Research Center](http://nearspace.zju.edu.cn/) from [School of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://saa.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University.
