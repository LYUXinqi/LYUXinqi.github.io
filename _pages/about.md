I'm a second-year doctoral student from [School of EECS](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests include neural networks, machine learning, flow networks, thermal management, and flow control.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chen Weifang, Director of the Near-Space Vehicle Research Center at Polytechnic Institute, Zhejiang University.
